Archaeologists have a variety of hypotheses to explain the presence of these vessels, but their purpose remains elusive. What do you think they were used for?"

The potter had to remove the air pockets in between the coils to prevent the handles from breaking during firing. This is difficult to do without accidentally pressing the individual coils together to form one larger coil."
